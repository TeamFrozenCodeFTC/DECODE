     * Does not use Integral or Derivative terms as they are usually unnecessary
     * for this controller and can often add instability unless tuned appropriately.
     * Uses momentum damping based off the robot's natural deceleration instead of {@code
     * kA} (acceleration gain).
     *
     * @param kP the proportional gain, how much power the robot reacts to error.
     *          Usually around 0.01.
     * @param kV the velocity gain, how much power the robot requires per
     *                  velocity. Should be around 1/maxVelocity or 1/65 ~= 0.015
     * @param kS the static gain, the minimum power required to start moving.
     *                Should be determined experimentally. Should be around 0.05.
